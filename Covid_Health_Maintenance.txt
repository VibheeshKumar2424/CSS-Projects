Emotional Health


Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social wellbeing. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine
how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and
adolescence through adulthood.




Drink a lot of Water


Drinking plenty of water can help you lose weight. This is because water can increase satiety and boost your metabolic rate. Some
evidence suggests that increasing water intake can promote weight loss by slightly increasing your metabolism, which can increase the
number of calories you burn on a daily basis.




Have a cup of green tea
